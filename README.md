# Metgen_plasticityanalysis
Analysis of shotgun metagenomic plasticity - data availability open to public after publication

############This repository describes the work used to explore gut microbiome dynamics in two species denoted as AS and CR
Bioinformatic code used for this project can be found in the holoflow directory.

############Analyses we have done include

1. Hill numbers to distill diversity metric information
2. Mixed effects linear models to explore the dynamics of these diversity metrics through time
3. PERMANOVA to explore directional changes in the gut microbiome
4. Species distribution modelling to model the functional changes of the gut microbiome and interrelate these with species dynamics
5. Characterisation of the functional potential of each bacterial species
